<p>Not best to use right now if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Need to process payments on form submission</li>
  <li>Need to send an autoresponder email</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>But maybe autoresponders can be done via Google Forms instead?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Best to use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When conditional logic is needed in the form</li>
  <li>
    When clients need to see the records because they never really do it through
    WP
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Form plugins are 99% of the reason I've use WP.</p>
<p>Formspree is good, but limited.</p>
<p>A website stack should not be dictated by the form software.</p>
<p>
  Need to use a form plugin? Then it instantly requires paid hosting and makes
  SEO way worse.
</p>
<p>
  A WP site will cost 10 times as much in development costs. That goes up over
  time.
